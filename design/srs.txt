1. Introduction:
Overview: SafeComm is a secure messaging platform that uses RSA encryption to ensure secure communication between users. Passwords are hashed to protect user credentials.
Purpose: To allow users to send and receive encrypted messages, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data.

2. Use Case Diagram:
Users can register, log in, send messages (encrypted), and receive messages (decrypted). The system provides basic authentication and message security.

3. Functional Requirements:
User Registration: Users can create accounts with usernames and passwords. The password is hashed before storage.
User Login: Authentication based on the hashed password, theres now a cookie and session id for each logged in user
Message Encryption: Messages are encrypted using the recipient’s RSA public key.
Message Decryption: Messages are decrypted using the recipient’s RSA private key.

4. Non-Functional Requirements:
Security: All messages and passwords must be encrypted. RSA encryption ensures confidentiality, and passwords are stored as secure hashes (e.g., SHA-256).
Performance: The system must efficiently handle multiple users and messages, with RSA encryption being performed only when necessary.
Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users and messages with minimal performance degradation.

5. System Architecture:
Socket programming is used to relay messages using a server between any two clients

6. Database Design:
User Table: Stores user ids, usernames, hashed passwords and public key
Session Table: Stores session ids, usernames, create_timestamp
